 <P>America is full of great sights and places to visit, but it's the Statue of Liberty that represents the 
 United States like no other place. This symbol of freedom in New York City 
 was gifted by the French to the American people in 1896. </P>
 
 
 <h2> #4 Machu Picchu, Peru </h2>

 <p>If you are planning to see only one attraction in South America, this is the place to come. The ancient Inca city of 
 Machu Picchu is arguably the most impressive ruined city in the world.</p>

 <p>If you've visited places like the Colosseum in Rome or the Acropolis in Athens, built over 2,000 years ago, you may think you have a good handle on ancient sites. But the Pyramids of Giza take ancient to a whole other level. These were built over 4,500 years ago. 
 Tourists were coming to see these magnificent structures literally thousands of years ago.</p>
